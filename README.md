# Basic Two-Tier AWS Architecture

This provides a template for running a simple two-tier architecture on Amazon
Web services. The premise is that you have stateless app servers running behind
an ELB serving traffic.

To run, configure your AWS provider as described in 

https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html

Run with a command like this:

```
terraform apply 
   
```
